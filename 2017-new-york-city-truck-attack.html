            On October 31, 2017, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov drove a rented pickup truck into cyclists and runners for about one mile (1.6 kilometers) of the Hudson River Park's bike path alongside West Street from Houston Street south to Chambers Street in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The vehicle-ramming attack killed eight people, six of whom were foreign tourists, and injured thirteen others.<br/><br/>After crashing the truck into a school bus, Saipov exited, apparently wielding two guns (later found to be a paintball gun and a pellet gun). He was shot in the abdomen by a policeman and arrested. A Black Standard and a document indicating allegiance to the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) were found in the truck.<br/><br/>A federal grand jury indicted 29-year-old Saipov, who had immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010, with eight murders in the aid of racketeering, twelve attempted murders in the aid of racketeering, destruction of a motor vehicle and providing material support for a terrorist organization. Following the 2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting, this was the second terrorist attack by a person who participated in the Diversity Immigrant Visa program. After the attack, anti-vehicle bollards were installed on the Hudson River Park bike path. Saipov was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2023.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Attack ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>At 2:06 p.m.
