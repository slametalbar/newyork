            Amy Laura Wax (born January 19, 1953) is an American legal scholar and neurologist.  She is a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Her work addresses issues in social welfare law and policy, as well as the relationship of the family, the workplace, and labor markets. She has often made remarks about non-white people that have been described by some of her contemporaries and colleagues as white supremacist and racist. In 2024, she was suspended from teaching for one year. Wax sued the University of Pennsylvania in response, seeking a reversal of the suspension and damages for lost wages and reputational harm. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Wax was born on January 19, 1953, in Troy, New York. She was raised with her two sisters in an observant, conservative Jewish family in Troy, where she attended public schools.  Her father worked in the garment industry, and her mother was a teacher and a government administrator in Albany, New York.<br/><br/>Wax attended Troy High School, where she was head of the school's senior honor roll.
