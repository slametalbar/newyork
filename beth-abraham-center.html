            Beth Abraham Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing is a medical facility in Bronx, New York, which was founded as the Beth Abraham Home for Incurables.  It was originally a long-term residential care facility, but was later expanded to include rehabilitation services.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Bertha Alperstein founded Beth Abraham in memory of her late husband Avraham Eliezer Alperstein. The property was acquired in January 1920 for $115,000 (equivalent to $1,805,042 in 2024), and the new hospital opened on March 21, 1920.  On its fifth anniversary, the hospital celebrated the opening of a new building costing $500,000 (equivalent to $7,848,007 in 2024) which increased its total capacity to 225 patients.<br/><br/>In January 1952, the hospital's name was shortened to Beth Abraham Home, owing to developments in "rehabilitative physical and psychological techniques [which gave] patients a chance to advance medically and socially far beyond former concepts of mere custodial care."<br/><br/>In 1963, Beth Abraham began "an active affiliation with a neighboring teaching institution, Montefiore Hospital".<br/><br/>In 1996, The New York Times wrote that "the 520-bed Bronx hospital" was opening new facilities in Westchester County and in Manhattan. Although they also use the name Beth Abraham - Centers Health Care Nursing and Rehabilitation, as of 2021 Montefiore's "Find a Doctor" still lists "Beth Abraham Hospital. 612 Allerton Avenue.
