            Booth Memorial Hospital is the name of any of the hospitals affiliated with The Salvation Army (TSA); the latter was "founded by William Booth in 1878." The first of these "opened Booth Memorial in Manhattan in 1914 and its center in Flushing in 1957." Salvation Army Booth Memorial Hospital is a longer name used for some of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== New York City's Booth Memorial Hospital ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Booth Memorial Hospital in Flushing, Queens, New York City was "the largest voluntary hospital in Queens." The hospital began in 1892 as a non-profit hospital in Manhattan. The hospital moved to two other Manhattan locations in subsequent years. The campus in Queens was dedicated and opened on February 5, 1957. Around this time, North Hempstead Turnpike was renamed Booth Memorial Avenue. In 1992, the hospital was purchased from the Salvation Army by New York Hospital in Manhattan, becoming New York Hospital Queens in May 1993.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== St. Louis's Booth Memorial Hospital ==<br/><br/>Booth Memorial Hospital is also the name given to a hospital located in St. Louis founded by The Salvation Army. Booth was built in 1855 and "stood at least until the 1950s" when it was torn down.
