            The Bristol stool scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human faeces into seven categories. It is used in both clinical and experimental fields.<br/><br/>It was developed at the Bristol Royal Infirmary as a clinical assessment tool in 1997, by Stephen Lewis and Ken Heaton and is widely used as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for various diseases of the bowel, as well as a clinical communication aid; including being part of the diagnostic triad for irritable bowel syndrome.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Interpretation ==<br/><br/>The seven types of stool are:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (difficult to pass)<br/><br/>Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy<br/><br/>Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface<br/><br/>Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft (average stool)<br/><br/>Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges<br/><br/>Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool (diarrhea)<br/><br/>Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid (diarrhea)<br/><br/>Types 1 and 2 indicate constipation, with 3 and 4 being the ideal stools as they are easy to defecate while not containing excess liquid, and 6 and 7 indicate diarrhea.<br/><br/>In the initial study, in the population examined in this scale, the type 1 and 2 stools were more prevalent in females, while the type 5 and 6 stools were more prevalent in males; furthermore, 80% of subjects who reported rectal tenesmus (sensation of incomplete defecation) had type 7. These and other data have allowed the scale to be validated. The initial research did not include a pictorial chart with this being developed at a later point.<br/><br/>The Bristol stool scale is also very sensitive to changes in intestinal transit time caused by medications, such as antidiarrhoeal loperamide, senna, or anthraquinone with laxative effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Uses ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) typically report that they suffer with abdominal cramps and constipation.<br/><br/>In some patients, chronic constipation is interspersed with brief episodes of diarrhoea; while a minority of patients with IBS have only diarrhoea.
