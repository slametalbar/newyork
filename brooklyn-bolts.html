            The Brooklyn Bolts were a professional American football team based in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. They were a charter member of the Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL), which was trying to become the developmental league for the National Football League. They played their home games at MCU Park.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In August 2014, it was announced that Brooklyn was awarded a franchise for the upcoming 2014 season of the Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL).<br/><br/>All of the teams in the league are owned by the FXFL, but local Minor League Baseball franchises are responsible for the operations of each team. The Bolts worked in conjunction with the Brooklyn Cyclones who play at MCU Park on Coney Island.  By playing its games in Brooklyn, the Bolts became the first outdoor professional football team to play in New York City proper since 1983, when the New York Jets left Shea Stadium. (Two short-lived arena football teams, the Knights in 1988 and the CityHawks in 1997 and 1998, also played in the city; otherwise, all professional teams claiming to represent the city have played in either New Jersey or Long Island.)<br/><br/>On July 10, 2015, the league confirmed the Bolts would return for the 2015 season. Former NFL quarterback Josh Freeman played for the Bolts for the 2015 season and then signed with the Indianapolis Colts and started the Colts' final regular season game of 2015.<br/><br/>In early August 2016, Brooklyn Baseball Banter, a site that covers the Brooklyn Cyclones, reported that the Cyclones' front office was about to pull the plug on the Bolts and the FXFL at MCU Park, as the league had not contacted the Cyclones regarding a third season (the Cyclones were prepared to bring back the Bolts if the league was prepared to play).
