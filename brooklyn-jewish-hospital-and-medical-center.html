            The Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and Medical Center was an academic, sectarian hospital in Crown Heights and Prospect Heights in Central Brooklyn. It merged with St. John's Episcopal Hospital to form Interfaith Medical Center in 1983.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early days ===<br/><br/>The hospital's predecessor was the Brooklyn Hebrew Hospital Society, which formed in 1895 as a clinic; they served as a small dispensary and were located at 70 Johnson Street that grew to serve the burgeoning populations of Crown Heights and Prospect Heights.<br/><br/>In the early 20th century, many Jewish communities saw both benefit and need in developing modern hospital facilities. By 1901, local community leaders saw the need to expand the Society to a 50-bed hospital. They incorporated as Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn on November 9, 1901, and by 1903, had purchased an older hospital campus, the Memorial Hospital for Women and Children, to renovate and reopen. It was located on the block of Classon Avenue, between Prospect Place and St. Marks Avenue. Shortly after its purchase, the trustees decided that the community could support a much larger facility and spent several years fundraising, insisting that work not start until money was in hand to cover all the work.
