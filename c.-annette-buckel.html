            C. Annette Buckel (August 25, 1833 – August 17, 1912) was an American physician and the first female medical doctor in Oakland, California. Buckel worked to improve the welfare of women and children through her medical practice as well as her activism. During the Civil War, she appointed and supervised nurses in addition to nursing in the field.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Cloe Annette Buckel born August 25, 1833, in Warsaw, New York. Her given name is given variously as Cloe or Chloe, though she preferred to be called Annette. She was the only child of Thomas Buckel and his wife, whose given name is not known but whose surname was Bartlett. Both of her parents died when Cloe was three months old, and she was raised by her grandparents until age four. After her grandparents died, Buckel was raised by her aunts, young women who were strict disciplinarians and often told Cloe how much they resented having to raise her. <br/><br/>At age fourteen, Buckel left her relatives to teach in an elementary school in rural New York state, boarding with the parents of her students. She also worked in a burnishing factory in Connecticut, teaching herself Latin as she worked and living with her employer.
