            Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) is the academic medical center of Columbia University and the largest campus of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. The center's academic wing consists of Columbia's colleges and schools of Physicians and Surgeons, Dental Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health. <br/><br/>The center's healthcare wing include Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and the Audubon Biomedical Research Park. The center is located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, New York City.<br/><br/>The campus covers several blocks—primarily between West 165th and 169th Streets from Riverside Drive to Audubon Avenue.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The medical center was built in the 1920s on the site of Hilltop Park, the one-time home stadium of the New York Yankees. The land was donated by Edward Harkness, who also donated most of the financing for the original buildings. Built specifically to house a medical school and Presbyterian Hospital, it was the first academic medical center in the world. Formerly known as the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC), the name change followed the 1997 formation of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, a merger of two medical centers each affiliated with an Ivy League university: Columbia-Presbyterian with Columbia University, and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, with Cornell University's Weill Cornell Medical College.<br/><br/>The Medical and Graduate Education Building was designed by architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro and Gensler, and the structural engineer was Leslie E. Robertson Associates.
