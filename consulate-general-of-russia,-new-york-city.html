            The Consulate-General of Russia in New York City is the diplomatic mission of the Russian Federation in New York City. Opened in 1994, the consulate is located at 9 East 91st Street in the former John Henry Hammond House on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.  A consulate of the former Soviet Union had previously existed on East 61st Street from 1933 until 1948.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The house ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The house was built in 1903 by John H. Hammond, a New York City banker. The five-story Renaissance style limestone townhouse was designed by Carrère and Hastings, who were also responsible for the design of the New York Public Library Main Branch, and is regarded as one of their finest residences. The ground floor has pronounced banded rustication, while the other floors contain progressively smaller windows. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 1933–1948 ==<br/><br/>In 1933 the United States extended diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union, and on 21 April 1934 the Soviets opened a consulate-general in New York City at 7–9 East 61st Street.<br/><br/>On 31 July 1948, Oksana Kasenkina, a Soviet citizen and a teacher to the children of diplomats of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, appealed to the editor of a Russian-language newspaper in New York City for refuge, and arrangements were made to take Kasenkina to Reed Farm in Valley Cottage, which was operated by the White Russian Tolstoy Foundation. Whilst at the Farm, Kasenkina wrote a letter to Soviet Consul-General Jacob Lomakin ending: "I implore you, I implore you once more, don't let me perish here. I am without willpower." On 7 August Lomakin with vice-consul Chepurnykh arrived at the farm.
