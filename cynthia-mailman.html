            Cynthia Mailman (born 1942 in the Bronx, New York) is an American painter and educator. She is known for figurative and landscape works done in a "cool, pared-down" style. Her early paintings were presented from a perspective inside the artist's VW van, looking outward, and include mirrors, wipers or other interior elements against the exterior landscape. By doing this, Mailman put the observer in the driver's seat, which is also the artist's point of view. According to Lawrence Alloway, "The interplay of directional movement and expanding space is a convincing expansion of the space of landscape painting".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education ==<br/><br/>Mailman graduated with an academic diploma in Advertising Art and Illustration from the School of Industrial Art (SIA), earned a BS in Fine Art and Education from Pratt Institute, and received an MFA in painting from the Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Feminism ==<br/><br/>Cynthia Mailman was an active participant in the feminist art movement. She was an original member of SOHO20 Artists (est. 1973), often called SOHO20 Gallery, a feminist, artist-run exhibition space. Mailman also participated in The Sister Chapel, a collaborative installation that celebrated female role models, which premiered at P.S.1 in January 1978.
