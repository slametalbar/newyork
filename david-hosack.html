            David Hosack   (August 31, 1769 – December 22, 1835) was an American physician, botanist, and educator. He remains widely known as the doctor who tended to the fatal injuries of Alexander Hamilton after his duel with Aaron Burr in July 1804, and who had similarly tended to Hamilton's son Philip after his fatal 1801 duel with George Eacker. He established several institutions including Elgin Botanic Garden and a medical school at Rutgers University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and college ==<br/><br/>Hosack was born in New York City, the first of seven children of Alexander Hossack  [sic], a merchant from Elgin in Scotland, and his wife Jane Arden. Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, Hosack was sent to New Jersey academies to further his education, first in Newark and then Hackensack. He would go on to attend Columbia College, now a branch of Columbia University, where he began as a student of art, but eventually became fascinated by medicine.<br/><br/>At Columbia, Hosack entered into a medical apprenticeship with Dr. Richard Bayley. While Hosack was studying at New York Hospital in April 1788, a violent crowd formed outside to protest body snatching, the practice of illicitly obtaining cadavers from graveyards for use in medical training. The rioters had gathered after a medical student taunted a group of children by waving a corpse's arm at them from a window, resulting in several days of violence that was later called the doctors' riot.
