            "Destroy Rock &amp; Roll" is a song by British electronic musician Mylo. It was released as the second single from his debut album of the same name. Produced by Mylo, the song samples the recording "Invocation for Judgement Against and Destruction of Rock Music", released in 1984 by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and her New Age organization Church Universal and Triumphant. Samples from the recording make up the entirety of the song's vocal track, which explicitly lists several popular 1980s musicians and bands. The track peaked at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, and also reached the top 40 on the Finnish singles charts.<br/><br/>The song's accompanying music video depicts Mylo in a large white room spraying graffiti art depicting symbols, pictures, or the names of the artists mentioned on the track.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Composition ==<br/><br/>All of the vocals and lyrics are sampled from "Invocation for Judgement Against and Destruction of Rock Music", a 1984 recording by religious organization Church Universal and Triumphant. The original recording heavily condemns rock music, and many popular artists from the 1980s; it appears on a release entitled The Sounds of American Doomsday Cults Volume 14.<br/><br/>"Destroy Rock &amp; Roll" begins with the voice of a Preacher condemning "All perversions of the third eye through distorted and exaggerated images, perverted movements of the body and breakdancing and other forms of dancing." The same Preacher calls for "the destroying of rock music directed specifically against children through the videos that were portrayed," and "working specifically through" certain individuals. The Preacher also calls for "the judgement of the sacred fire on this hour before the throne of Almighty God" through these individuals.
