            George Thomas McDonald (April 28, 1944 – January 26, 2021) was an American philanthropist and social worker who was known for being the founder of homeless advocacy group The Doe Fund.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>McDonald was born in Spring Lake, New Jersey, on April 28, 1944, to Helen (née Storminger) and John McDonald. His mother was a homemaker and his father was an insurance executive. He grew up in a single parent household with his father leaving before he was born. He spent much of his early years visiting his mother who was in a hospital with tuberculosis. He attended a Catholic elementary and middle school. He would attribute his upbringing to the learnings from priests in the school. He was known to have had ambitions to becoming the President and had subscribed to The Congressional Record as early as 8.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>In the mid-1960s, he dropped out of college and went on to join a department store as a salesman in New Jersey, before going on to serving as an executive on clothing companies in New York's Garment District. It was at this time that he was exposed to the homeless in New York City's parks, subways, and streets.
