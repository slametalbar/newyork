            The history of Cornell University begins when its two founders, Andrew Dickson White of Syracuse and Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, met in the New York State Senate in January 1864. Together, they established Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1865. The university was initially funded by Ezra Cornell's $400,000 endowment and by New York's 989,920-acre (4,006.1 km2) allotment of the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862.<br/><br/>However, even before Ezra Cornell and Andrew White met in the New York Senate, each had separate plans and dreams that would draw them toward their collaboration in founding Cornell. White believed in the need for a great university for the nation that would take a radical new approach to education; and Cornell, who had great respect for education and philanthropy, desired to use his money "to do the greatest good." Abraham Lincoln's signing of Vermont Senator Justin Morrill's Land Grant Act into law was also critical to the formation of many universities, including Cornell, in the post–Civil War era.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Precursors ==<br/><br/>A generation before the founding of Cornell University, abolitionist and philanthropist Gerrit Smith of Peterboro in Upstate New York proposed the creation of a major university for the state. In 1835, he hosted the relocated meeting of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society at his home after it was forced out of Utica (Oneida County) by the mayor. Smith was active in numerous reform movements and widely known for his philanthropy. In addition to emergency relief and anti-slavery efforts, he provided significant financial support to progressive educational institutions including Oberlin College, the Oneida Institute, Berea College, and Fisk University. He also considered founding a university in New York for the "highest education of men and women, white and black," but the plan was never realized.
