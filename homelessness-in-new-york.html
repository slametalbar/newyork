            In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached some of its highest levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  As of July, 2024, over 132 thousand individuals slept in NYC homeless shelters, not accounting for the thousands sleeping in unsheltered public spaces. Over 200,000 members of the population were estimated to be temporarily doubled up in the homes of others, so the total estimate reaches nearly 350,000 homeless people, according to the Coalition for the Homeless. <br/><br/>The number of homeless individuals residing in NYC's shelter system has skyrocketed in the past year, rising 53% in 2024 when compared to the statistics in 2023, despite efforts from Mayor Eric Adams. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Demographics ==<br/><br/>The Coalition for the Homeless, a New York-based non-profit organization, reports that 30% of single adults entering the shelter system each year enter directly from institutional settings. In 2018 6,100 adults entered from institutional settings, including: 3,466 from prison, 1,294 from non-hospital facilities (i.e. nursing homes), 760 from psychiatric hospitals, and 580 discharged from Rikers Island. <br/><br/>In 2019, 59% of Single Adults in shelters were Black, 27% were Hispanic, 10% were White (non-Hispanic), 4% Unknown/other, and 0.4% Asian/Pacific Islander. Black people are disproportionately homeless, making up 29% of NYC residents (35% difference). Whites are underrepresented, making up 32% of NYC residents (22% difference).
