            Houston Methodist Hospital is the flagship quaternary care hospital of Houston Methodist academic medical center. Located in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, Houston Methodist Hospital was established in 1919 during the height of the Spanish influenza epidemic as an outreach ministry of Methodist Episcopal Church. Houston Methodist comprises eight hospitals, an academic institute, a primary care group, and more than 300 locations throughout greater Houston.<br/><br/>The hospital has consistently ranked as "One of America's Best Hospitals" according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. The hospital has earned worldwide recognition in multiple specialties including cardiovascular surgery, cancer, epilepsy treatment and organ transplantation.<br/><br/>Houston Methodist System changed its official name to Houston Methodist in 2013, to distinguish themselves from the 80+ Methodist Hospitals in the U.S. and to reflect their Houston roots.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Originally located near downtown Houston, after a $1 million donation from Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen, the hospital relocated to the Texas Medical Center and opened a 300-bed facility in 1951.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Michael DeBakey ===<br/><br/>Heart surgeon Michael E. DeBakey (1908–2008), a faculty member and later Chancellor Emeritus of Baylor College of Medicine, performed the first removal of a carotid artery blockage (1950); the first aorto-coronary bypass surgery (1964); the first use of a ventricular assist device to pump blood and support a diseased heart (1966); and some of the first U.S. heart transplants (1968 and 1969) at the hospital. DeBakey also created the first Dacron graft (1953).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Flooding and storms ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== 1976 flood ====<br/><br/>In 1976, unusually heavy rains caused more than $20 million in flood-related damage in the Texas Medical Center, knocking out power at three hospitals.
