            Dame Karen Elizabeth Pierce, Lady Roxburgh,  (born 23 September 1959), is a British diplomat who served as British Ambassador to the United States from March 2020 to February 2025. <br/><br/>She was previously the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations from 2018 to 2020 and the British Ambassador to Afghanistan from 2015 to 2016. She was the first woman appointed to the United States and United Nations roles, and the second in the Afghanistan role.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Pierce was born in Preston, Lancashire, where her grandparents were mill workers. Her father was an architectural draughtsman, and her mother was a secretary. <br/><br/>After attending Penwortham Girls' High School, a grammar school in Lancashire, she continued her studies at Girton College, Cambridge, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in English. In 2012 she was awarded a Master of Science in international strategy and diplomacy from the London School of Economics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Pierce joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1981, inspired by Margaret Thatcher's victory in the 1979 general election, which demonstrated to Pierce that women could "reach the top". After studying Japanese, she was posted to Tokyo in 1984. In 1987 she returned to London and joined the FCO's Security Policy Department.
