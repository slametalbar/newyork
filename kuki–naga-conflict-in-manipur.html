            In the state of Manipur in northeast India, conflict arose between the Kukis and Nagas soon after India's independence. The Nagas, who dominated the northern hill regions of the state, attempted to homogenise the area in order to demand integration with the Naga Hills region further north. This caused displacement of Kukis to the southern districts as well as the central hill regions during the 1950s. Major clashes again occurred during 1992-98, leading to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and diplacement of 50,000–100,000 people.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Historical background ==<br/><br/>In the early 19th century, when the British established their protectorate over the state of Manipur, the Kuki tribes were said to be inhabiting the hills to the south of the Manipur valley, while the Naga tribes were distributed in the hills to the north.<br/><br/>This changed over the following decades, with the Kuki tribes migrating north and settling throughout the hills of Manipur.<br/><br/>This was assumed to be due to pressure from the tribes further south, the Lushais (present-day Mizos) and Kamhau-Suktes.<br/><br/>This movement caused the Kuki and Naga tribes to live side by side in most of the hills surrounding the Manipur valley. This cohabitation does not appear to have been any cause for friction. There were many instances where the Nagas invited the Kukis to settle next to them for their own protection and for mediating disputes between their own kindred tribes and settlements.
