            The Lee Strasberg Theatre &amp; Film Institute (originally the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute) is an acting school founded in 1969 by the actor, director, and acting teacher Lee Strasberg. The Institute is located in Union Square on East 15th Street, also known as Lee Strasberg Way, in New York City. The school has a secondary campus in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>For more than 40 years, the Institute has partnered with New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where students can earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The Los Angeles campus also offers an Associate of Occupational Studies degree. Until her January 2024 death, the Institute was under the artistic direction of Anna Strasberg, Lee Strasberg's widow. Students at the Lee Strasberg Theatre &amp; Film Institute learn method acting, an acting technique created and developed by Strasberg.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1931, Lee Strasberg co-founded the Group Theatre, hailed as "America's first true theatrical collective," alongside fellow directors Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford. In 1951, he became director of the Actors Studio in New York City, considered "the nation's most prestigious acting school," and, in 1966, he was involved in the foundation of the Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>After almost five decades of teaching private classes and shepherding generations of actors toward success at the Actors Studio, Strasberg established his own school in 1969, open to all those interested in learning The Method.
