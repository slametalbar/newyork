            This is a list of bicycle-sharing systems, both docked and dockless. As of December 2016, roughly 1,000 cities worldwide have bike-sharing programs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Bicycle-sharing systems ==<br/><br/>The following table lists bicycle-sharing systems around the world. Most systems listed allow users to pick up and drop off bicycles at any of the automated stations within the network (denoted as 3 Gen.). Other generations are described at Bicycle-sharing system, section Categorization.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Europe ==<br/><br/>The advertising company JCDecaux launched its "Cyclocity" programs initially in Vienna, Austria in 2003 and in Lyon, France in 2005. The company also started programs in other cities in Europe such as Paris, Córdoba, and Kazan, as well as cities outside of Europe, such as Brisbane, Australia. Smart cards are used to pay for use of the bikes.<br/><br/>Competitor Clear Channel, then operating as Adshel, opened the first example of this in Rennes in 1997, and has several other sites including Oslo, Stockholm, Sandnes and Trondheim, most generally similar to that offered by their competitor.<br/><br/>A different financial model called bicing is used in Barcelona, which is paid for by car owners parking on public streets and not by advertising – which is contracted to JCDecaux in some places.
