            Mad Max is a 2015 action-adventure video game based on the Mad Max franchise developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game follows Max Rockatansky as he progresses through the wasteland building a vehicle, the Magnum Opus, to battle against a gang of hostile raiders led by Scabrous Scrotus and reach the storied "Plains of Silence", where he hopes to find peace. Mad Max emphasizes vehicular combat, in which players can use weapon and armor upgrades on their car to fight enemies. It is set in an open world, a post-apocalyptic wasteland consisting of deserts, canyons, and caves. The game adopted a free-flowing combat system, similar to Rocksteady Studios' Batman: Arkham series.<br/><br/>Two other Mad Max games, developed by Cory Barlog and Interplay Entertainment respectively, were in production before the announcement of this game, but neither of them were successfully released. Although Mad Max is not based on a specific film in the series, it was inspired by its universe, features locations that appear in the films, and franchise co-creator George Miller was consulted during the game's pre-production. Avalanche Studios found developing a vehicular-combat video game a challenge because of their inexperience with creating that type of game. Unlike Avalanche's previous games like the Just Cause series, Mad Max had a more mature tone.
