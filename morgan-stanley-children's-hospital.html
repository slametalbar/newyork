            Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian (MSCH or CHONY) is a women's and children's hospital at 3959 Broadway, near West 165th Street, in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is a part of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The hospital treats patients aged 0–21 from New York City and around the world. The hospital features a ACS verified Level I Pediatric Trauma Center and is named after financial firm Morgan Stanley, which largely funded its construction through philanthropy.<br/><br/>The hospital is affiliated with the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and many of its physicians are faculty members of the college.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The hospital has nearly 250 years of history in treating children, tracing its roots to the establishment of Columbia University's – then King's College – Department of Pediatrics in 1767. Initially founded as Babies Hospital, it was established in 1887 in a Brownstone on 55th Street and Lexington Avenue. At the time of its opening, New York City's hospitals only had 27 beds catering to infants.<br/><br/>In 1929, the hospital moved from its Lexington Avenue site to Upper Manhattan to become part of the Columbia–Presbyterian Medical Center. The hospital underwent various expansions throughout the years and, during the planning of the new building, the old hospital had 168 beds and six operating rooms.
