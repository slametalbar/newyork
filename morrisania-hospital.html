            Morrisania Hospital was a four-structure full service hospital with an 11-story main building that was built in 1926 and closed in 1976.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Morrisania Hospital was planned in the 1920s when the western Bronx was rapidly urbanizing with the opening of the new subway lines. <br/><br/>In 1933 the Jerome Avenue division of the Lexington Avenue line, running as an elevated train above River Avenue, was joined by the Concourse division of the Sixth Avenue line, planned in the 1920s. The few blocks between the two subway lines was speedily filled with five- and six story apartment houses, making that district the most densely populated in the borough. Dr. Isidore Goldberger and J. Lewis Amster successfully campaigned for a new city hospital to be built in that area.<br/><br/>The city appropriated funds for the new facility in 1922, and Mayor Jimmy Walker laid the cornerstone in 1926. Charles B. Meyers designed a complex that stretched across an entire city block from 167th Street to 168th Street on the hill between Walton and Gerard Avenues. Throughout the decade Meyers had designed a number of new city structures, including several city hospitals. The complex was opened on July 1, 1929.
