            The New York Sirens are a professional ice hockey team based in the New York metropolitan area that competes in the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL). They are one of the six charter franchises of the league. The team plays its home games at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Founding and inaugural season ===<br/><br/>On August 29, 2023, the PWHL revealed that one of its first six charter franchises would be located in the New York metropolitan area. The league announced on September 1 that Pascal Daoust, the former general manager for the QMJHL's Val-d'Or Foreurs, would be the team's inaugural general manager. On September 15, Howie Draper was named as the team's first head coach, taking a leave of absence from his position as head coach of the University of Alberta program to take the position. Each PWHL team was permitted three signings during the free agency period ahead of the 2023 PWHL Draft. On September 8, the team announced the signing of its first three players, United States national team members Alex Carpenter and Abby Roque, and Canadian national team member Micah Zandee-Hart. The draft was held on September 18; New York's first selection, at fourth overall, was defender Ella Shelton.<br/><br/>In November 2023, it was revealed that New York's colors would be turquoise, navy blue, and white.
