            The New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) serves to foster and advance the arts, culture, and creativity throughout New York State, according to its website. The goal of the council is to allow all New Yorkers to benefit from the contributions the arts give to the city of New York through its communities, education, economic growth, and daily life. Its funding encompasses various artistic fields, such as literary, visual, media, performing arts, specifically focusing on art education and the underserved communities.<br/><br/>The NYSCA prioritizes diverse communities, providing inclusive and fair participation in the arts for people of all ages and backgrounds, opportunities for those who want to experience the arts and cultural offerings, the impacts of arts and culture on all aspects of life, the transformation of art and its creative practices, and creativity as an asset.<br/><br/>It was established in 1960 through a bill introduced in the New York State Legislature by New York State Senator MacNeil Mitchell (1905–1996), with backing from Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and began its work in 1961. It awards more than 1,600 grants annually to arts, culture, and heritage non-profits and artists throughout the state.  Its headquarters are in Manhattan, New York City.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Values ==<br/><br/>The diversity within New York's communities<br/><br/>Equitable participation for people of all ages and backgrounds<br/><br/>The ability for everyone to access the arts and culture<br/><br/>Valuing the arts and the culture as they play a crucial role in the economy and health of the people<br/><br/>The progression and growth of the arts and creativity.<br/><br/>Treating creativity as a shared, beneficial asset within the community<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== The Budget System ===<br/><br/>The New York State's annual budget accounts for NYSCA's funding, and operates on a fiscal year of April - March.
