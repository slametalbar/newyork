            NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital is located in Park Slope in Brooklyn, New York, between 7th and 8th Avenues, on 6th Street. The academic hospital has 591 beds (including bassinets) and provides services to some 42,000 inpatients each year. In addition, approximately 500,000 outpatient visits and services are logged annually.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Services ==<br/><br/>New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital offers specialized care in the following areas: advanced and minimally invasive surgery, advanced otolaryngology, asthma and lung disease, cancer care, cardiology and cardiac surgery, diabetes and other endocrine disorders, digestive and liver disorders, healthy aging, neurosciences, orthopedic medicine and surgery, vascular medicine and surgery, and women's health.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Affiliations ==<br/><br/>NewYork–Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital is affiliated with Weill Cornell Medicine and is a teaching hospital for SUNY Downstate College of Medicine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Founded in 1881, NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital was the first Methodist hospital in the country. The original Romanesque Revival-style building was replaced in the 1930s.<br/><br/>On December 16, 1960, a mid-air collision over Staten Island left 134 people dead; one of the two aircraft that had collided crashed in Park Slope in Brooklyn. The only initial survivor, Stephen Baltz, an 11-year-old boy from Illinois, was thrown from that aircraft onto a snowbank. Badly burned and having inhaled burning fuel, he was taken to what was then Brooklyn's Methodist Hospital, where he succumbed to pneumonia the next day.
