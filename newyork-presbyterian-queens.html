            NewYork-Presbyterian Queens, stylized as NewYork-Presbyterian/Queens (NYP/Q or NYP/Queens), is a not-for-profit acute care and teaching hospital affiliated with Weill Cornell Medicine in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens in New York City. Formerly operating as Booth Memorial Hospital and New York Hospital Queens (NYHQ), it is located on the northeast corner of Main Street and Booth Memorial Avenue.<br/><br/>The hospital was formed in 1892 as the Rescue Home for Women, becoming known as Booth Memorial Hospital in 1919. The current Queens campus opened in 1957. The NewYork–Presbyterian Healthcare System had assumed control of the Booth Memorial Hospital until 2015, when the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, headquartered in Manhattan, assumed control and made the Booth Memorial Hospital a Queens campus.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The hospital began as a non-profit hospital in Manhattan operated by the Salvation Army called Booth Memorial Hospital and Medical Center, one of several Salvation Army hospitals around the United States to bear the "Booth Memorial Hospital" name. It was named after Salvation Army founder William Booth. It was originally opened in 1892 as a rescue home for women, particularly unmarried mothers, located at East 123rd Street in East Harlem. After several location changes, it was moved to 312–20 East 15th Street (also referred to as 314 and 316 East 15th Street) on the East Side in the 1910s in a joint venture with the American Red Cross, when it was officially named Booth Memorial Hospital. It was licensed as a general-care hospital in 1918.
