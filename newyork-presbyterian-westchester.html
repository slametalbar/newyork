            NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester (formerly NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital, and Lawrence Hospital Center before that) is a division of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, located in Bronxville, New York. It is a 288-bed general hospital providing inpatient and outpatient care primarily to residents of southern Westchester County. It is a designated Primary Stroke Center and a Level II Perinatal Center .<br/><br/>The hospital annually treats about 42,000 patients in its emergency department and delivers around 1,300 babies. It provides access to primary care physicians and specialists from ColumbiaDoctors, the faculty practice of Columbia University Medical Center, and NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Westchester, a multi-specialty physician practice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The hospital was founded in 1909 as Lawrence Hospital by prominent businessman William Van Duzer Lawrence, who recognized the need for a community hospital after his son fell ill with appendicitis and had to be transported to New York City.<br/><br/>In 2005, Lawrence Hospital Center became an affiliate member of the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System, and in 2014 it entered into a formal partnership with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital which resulted in the hospital being renamed NewYork-Presbyterian/Lawrence Hospital. Groundbreaking of a two-story, 40,000 sq. ft. cancer and surgery center occurred on June 18, 2013, whose construction cost $65 million.
