            Olajide Williams (born 1969) is an American neurologist and the founder of Hip-Hop Public Health. He is Chief of Staff and Professor of Neurology at Columbia University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Williams was born prematurely into the front seat of his mother's Volkswagen beetle, and spent most of the first year of his life in hospital. As a teenager, Williams attended Haileybury College in the United Kingdom. Williams trained in medicine in the University of Lagos. It was in Lagos that he first became interested in public health, recognising how many people were dying from preventable diseases. In an interview with the American Heart Association, Williams said that he felt "too African in England, and too English in Africa,", so instead moved to the United States. He completed his specialist training in neurology at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. It was whilst working at the Harlem Hospital Center that he recognised the same public health disconnect that he had seen in Lagos related to societal inequities. He subsequently earned a Master's of Public Health in 2004.
