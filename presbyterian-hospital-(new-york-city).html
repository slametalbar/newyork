            Presbyterian Hospital was a New York City hospital. It was founded in 1868 and began operations in 1872. It was originally located between East 70th Street and 71st Streets and Madison and Park Avenue. The hospital expanded continuously throughout the late 19th century, adding an outpatient dispensary in 1888, a school of nursing in 1892, and additional beds and services in 1892, 1893, 1904 and 1912.<br/><br/>In 1998, Presbyterian Hospital merged with New York Hospital, creating NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Presbyterian Hospital was founded by James Lenox in 1868, and began operations in 1872, in buildings designed by Richard Morris Hunt. During the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II, the hospital operated military wards or overseas hospital bases.<br/><br/>In 1910, the hospital became affiliated with Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and with other hospitals and institutes in Manhattan, including, in 1925, the Sloane Hospital for Women, an obstetrics and gynecology hospital founded in 1886. It also was affiliated with the Vanderbilt Clinic, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, the Neurological Institute of New York, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute.<br/><br/>Around 1920, Edward Harkness joined the hospital's board and donated the land to complete his vision of a combining a medical school and hospital.
