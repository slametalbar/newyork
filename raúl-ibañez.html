            Raúl Javier Ibañez (; born June 2, 1972) is an American former professional baseball left fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) now serving as vice president of baseball development and special projects for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played 11 of his 19 big league seasons for the Seattle Mariners, while also playing for the Kansas City Royals, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. While primarily a left fielder, Ibañez often saw considerable time as a designated hitter (DH), throughout his career.<br/><br/>An All-Star in 2009, Ibañez won the Player of the Week Award five times.  Despite not reaching 500 plate appearances in a single season until the age of 30, Ibañez batted .272 with 424 doubles, 305 home runs and 1,207 runs batted in (RBI) over nineteen major league seasons.  He had eight seasons with at least 20 home runs, two seasons with at least 30 home runs, six seasons with at least 90 RBI, four seasons with at least 100 RBI, and ten consecutive seasons (2002–2011) with at least 30 doubles.  In 2004, Ibañez tied an American League record with six hits in one game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and amateur and college ==<br/><br/>Ibañez's parents emigrated from Cuba to New York in 1970. His father, Juan Armando, who was a chemist in Cuba, worked in a warehouse in the United States. Ibañez attended Miami Sunset Senior High School, where he played on the baseball team as a catcher.
