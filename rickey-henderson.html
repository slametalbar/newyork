Before being drafted by Adelaide, Henderson supported Geelong.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== AFL career ==<br/><br/>Henderson made his debut for Adelaide in round 5, 2010 against the Western Bulldogs, injuring his hamstring in that game, but was recalled to the side in round 12. He went on to play out the season, kicking 13 goals in 12 games playing as a forward. At the end of the season he was promoted to the senior list. Henderson played 18 games in 2011 despite battling a hip injury late in the season. He played mainly on the wing, impressing with his pace, goalkicking and ability to create turnovers, and gathering 28 disposals against the Western Bulldogs in round 13.<br/><br/>In 2012 Henderson played 12 matches despite missing a period of the season with an ankle injury.
