            Daniel Joseph "Rusty" Staub (April 1, 1944 – March 29, 2018) was an American professional baseball player and television color commentator. He played in Major League Baseball for 23 seasons as a right fielder, designated hitter, and first baseman. He was nicknamed "le Grand Orange" by Expos fans.<br/><br/>A six-time All-Star known for his hitting prowess, Staub produced 2,716 hits over his playing career, just 284 hits shy of the 3,000 hit plateau. He was an original member of the Montreal Expos and the team's first star.  Although he played just 518 of his 2,951 games as an Expo, his enduring popularity led them to retire his number in 1993, while the Mets inducted him into their team Hall of Fame in 1986.<br/><br/>Staub was also known for his charitable work through the Rusty Staub Foundation, supporting emergency food pantries in New York; and for establishing the New York Police and Fire Widows’ and Children’s Benefit Fund. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Staub was born in New Orleans on April 1, 1944, to Raymond and Alma Staub. He was given the nickname "Rusty" by a nurse in the hospital shortly after he was born because of his red hair. Ray Staub had been a minor league catcher in the Class D Florida State League in 1937-38.
