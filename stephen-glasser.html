<h1>Stephen Glasser</h1>
            
            Stephen Randall Glass (born September 15, 1972) is a former American journalist. He worked for The New Republic from 1995 to 1998 until an internal investigation by the magazine determined the majority of stories he wrote either contained false information or were fictitious.<br/><br/>Following the journalism scandal, Glass pursued a career in law. Although he earned a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center and passed the bar exam in New York and California, he was unable to become a licensed attorney in either state over concerns derived from his scandal. Glass instead found work as a paralegal at the law firm Carpenter, Zuckerman &amp; Rowley, serving as the director of special projects and trial-team coordinator.<br/><br/>Glass made a brief return to writing when he fictionalized his story in his 2003 novel The Fabulist. The same year, the scandal was dramatized in the film Shattered Glass, which is based on a Vanity Fair article of the same name and stars Hayden Christensen as Glass.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Journalism career ==<br/><br/>Glass grew up in a Jewish family in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, and attended Highland Park High School. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania as a University Scholar and was an executive editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian. After his graduation, Glass worked for the conservative Policy Review before being hired by The New Republic in 1995 as an editorial assistant.
