            The French Laundry is a three-Michelin star French and Californian cuisine restaurant located in Yountville, California, in the Napa Valley. Sally Schmitt opened The French Laundry in 1978 and designed her menus around local, seasonal ingredients; she was a visionary chef and pioneer of California cuisine. Since 1994, the chef and owner of The French Laundry is Thomas Keller. The restaurant building dates from 1900 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The building was constructed as a saloon in 1896 by a Scottish stonesman for Pierre Guillaume. A 1906 law outlawed the sale and consumption of alcohol in the area around the Veterans Home of California Yountville, and the building was bought in 1920 by John Lande who used it as a French steam laundry, which is the origin of the restaurant's name.<br/><br/>In 1978, Sally Schmitt and her husband Don, a former bank appraiser, the then-mayor of Yountville, purchased the building and renovated it into a restaurant. They kept the name, the French Laundry, because locals still referred to the building as such. The French Laundry was one of the first restaurants to offer what would become known as California cuisine. The Schmitts ran the restaurant for 17 years before selling it to Thomas Keller in 1994.
