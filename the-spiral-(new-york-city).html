            The Spiral, also known as 66 Hudson Boulevard, is a 66-floor, 1,031-foot (314 m) skyscraper with 2.85 million square feet (265,000 m2), on 34th Street between Hudson Boulevard and Tenth Avenue in Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York City. It was developed by Tishman Speyer, constructed by Turner Construction, and opened in 2023.<br/><br/>The building got its name as each floor has outdoor gardens that spiral around the facade of the building in a continuous green pathway. It was designed by Bjarke Ingels Group, which also designed the nearby West 57. Space Copenhagen provided interior design services. The building includes a clubhouse and an open-air terrace with panoramic city views on the 66th floor, along with a lounge. The building has an irrigation system provided by Bosch that is designed to save 4.5 million gallons of water per year compared to other systems.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The tower was conceptualized in 2014 as the Hudson Spire, with a 1,800-foot (550 m) roof height and a 2,000-foot (610 m) architectural height. It was marketed as the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Tishman Speyer spent $438 million acquiring the site.
