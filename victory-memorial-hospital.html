            Victory Memorial Hospital was a 254-bed medical facility. It was announced in 2006 that they're closing; they were acquired by SUNY Downstate Medical Center in 2009 and renamed SUNY Downstate at Bay Ridge.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Victory Memorial was a not-for-profit, voluntary hospital. Most of the hospital's "complex of dun-colored buildings at the southeastern edge of Bay Ridge" were built in 1927, but they opened earlier in a single building at their 92nd Street/Seventh Avenue Brooklyn location.<br/><br/>Decades ago, the families whose children were born therein were largely Irish and Italian; before closing, they were "more likely to be Chinese or Russian" or "speak Urdu, Tagalog, Arabic and Spanish."<br/><br/>In the 1960s, Victory Memorial built a new wing and added 64 beds, with recognition given for "increasing hospital facilities in Brooklyn."<br/><br/>On June 25, 2021 Maimonides Medical Center broke ground for a new 15,000 square foot, free standing Emergency Department at Victory. The event was seen WABC-7, WPIX-11 and News12.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Incidents ===<br/><br/>Two patients were murdered in the hospital by the son of one of them in 1999.<br/><br/>The driver and a bystander died when "a tank truck delivering liquid oxygen exploded outside" the hospital. A year-long investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board discovered "a complex, explosive chemical reaction, lasting a second or less" described as a "series of events never before observed."<br/><br/>H.I.V.-Tainted blood given "during emergency ulcer surgery."<br/><br/>"The hospital's director of radiology" and "the hospital's assistant director of radiology" pleaded guilty to "failure to file a [tax] return for three years." They ran a side business that "supplies radiology technicians to various health-care providers" (including Victory Memorial).
