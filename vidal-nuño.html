            Vidal Vicente Nuño [vee-dahl' nooh'-nio] (born July 26, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Arizona Diamondbacks, Seattle Mariners, Baltimore Orioles, and Tampa Bay Rays. The Cleveland Indians selected Nuño in the 48th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut in 2013 with the Yankees.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Amateur career ==<br/><br/>Nuño attended Sweetwater High School in National City, California, where he played for the school's baseball team. As a junior, in 2004, Nuño recorded 107 strikeouts and was named the Mesa League Pitcher of the Year.<br/><br/>Due to his poor academic track record, Nuño could not receive a scholarship from a Division I school. Wanting to leave the San Diego metropolitan area, he attended Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas, where he played college baseball for the Baker Wildcats in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In two seasons at Baker, Nuño had a 15–7 win–loss record. He was named the Heart of America Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year as a junior in 2008.
