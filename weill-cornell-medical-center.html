            Weill Cornell Medical Center (; previously known as New York Hospital, Old New York Hospital, and City Hospital) is a research hospital in New York City. It is the teaching hospital for Cornell University's medical school and is part of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. <br/><br/>The hospital was founded in 1771 with a charter from George III.
