            "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story" is the finale song of the musical Hamilton, based on the life of Alexander Hamilton, which premiered on Broadway in 2015. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Synopsis ==<br/><br/>After the death of Alexander Hamilton, the already deceased George Washington comes forward and repeats a line from his earlier song, "History Has Its Eyes on You": "Let me tell you what I wish I'd known/When I was young and dreamed of glory/You have no control", then the rest of the cast joins in with this song's title: "Who lives, who dies, who tells your story."<br/><br/>Aaron Burr individually reintroduces Thomas Jefferson and James Madison as "President Jefferson" and "President Madison". Both Presidents begrudgingly express respect for Hamilton and the financial system he created.<br/><br/>Angelica points out to the audience that Hamilton was the only one of the Founding Fathers who didn't live long enough to have his story told. Burr raises the question of who tells one's story after one is dead and gone.<br/><br/>Hamilton's wife Eliza Hamilton then comes forward and takes the largest part of the song, revealing that she lived for another 50 years after her husband's death, and all the efforts she made to tell her husband's story, as well as the stories of his fellow American Revolutionary War veterans, and of George Washington when she raises funds for the Washington Monument. She sings of her proudest accomplishment: founding the first private orphanage in New York City, and how the orphans there remind her of her orphaned husband and of raising their late son. Throughout her part of the song, the word "Time" is repeated and emphasized as a motif, representing how Hamilton always felt he was running out of time and contrasts that with the large amount of time Eliza had to tell his story and preserve his legacy. Finally, she expresses her longing to see Alexander again in the afterlife; her final line is "It's only a matter of time." The rest of the cast splits between singing the word "Time" and the song's title, "Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?" As the song ends, Eliza is met by Hamilton, who shakes her hand and leads her to the front of the stage.
