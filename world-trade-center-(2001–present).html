            The new World Trade Center (WTC) is a complex of buildings in Lower Manhattan, New York City, replacing the original seven buildings on the same site that were destroyed during the September 11 attacks of 2001. The area is currently being redeveloped with up to six skyscrapers, four of which have been finished as of 2024; A memorial and museum is at the new plaza; which is the elevated Liberty Park adjacent to the site, containing the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and the Vehicular Security Center; the Perelman Performing Arts Center; and a transportation hub. The 104-story One World Trade Center, being the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, is the lead building for the new complex.<br/><br/>The buildings are among many created by the World Trade Centers Association. The original World Trade Center included the Twin Towers, were opened in 1973 and were the tallest buildings in the world at the time of their completion. They were destroyed on the morning of September 11, 2001, when al-Qaeda members hijacked two Boeing 767 jets and flew them into the towers in a coordinated act of terrorism, killing 2,753 people. The resulting collapse of the World Trade Center caused structural failure in the surrounding buildings as well. The process of cleaning up and recovery at the World Trade Center site took eight months, after which site redevelopment commenced.<br/><br/>After years of delay and controversy, reconstruction at the World Trade Center site started in 2004.
